"description":"The <i>Text<\/i> is Book 1 of 4 (three books and one supplement) of the A Course in Miracles series. <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, also known as \"the Course\" or ACIM, was scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman. It is a self-study course that aims to assist listeners, readers, and students in achieving spiritual transformation. ACIM presents a purely non-dualistic philosophy of forgiveness and includes practical lessons and applications for the practice of forgiveness in one's daily life. <br /><br />As its title implies, <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i> is arranged throughout as a teaching device. It consists of three books: <i>Text, Workbook for Students,<\/i> and <i>Manual for Teachers.<\/i> The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depends on their particular needs and preferences. Two supplements to the Course: \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", are also included as part of ACIM. <br /><br />The curriculum the Course presents is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end. <br /><br />Book 1: <i>Text<\/i> is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the lessons in Book 2, the <i>Workbook for Students.<\/i> Without the practical application the <i>Workbook<\/i> provides, the <i>Text<\/i> would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims. <br /><br />Book 2: <i>Workbook for Students<\/i> includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the <i>Workbook<\/i> is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal. Some of the ideas the <i>Workbook<\/i> presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true. <br /><br />Book 3: <i>Manual for Teachers<\/i> is written in question and answer form, and provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the <i>Text<\/i>. The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the lessons in its <i>Workbook<\/i> intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit. <br /> \n<br />Supplements to ACIM, \"Psychotherapy: Purpose, Process, Practice\" and \"The Song of Prayer\", were scribed by Dr. Helen Schucman, as was <i>A Course in Miracles<\/i>, and are extensions of its principles."},

"description":"This is the second in this series of Core Words. After learning the first 100, this audiobook has the core 500 words used in the SATs and GREs over the last 50 years. This audiobook is best used after the Core 100 words are mastered so as not to intimidate the student. <br /><br />The first audiobook is quick and brief, just focusing on the core knowledge needed for doing well in this area of the test as well as becoming a better reader and writer. Choate learned that the first step in learning a subject should be an easy accessible one. Most Test Prep books strut across the stage with length and depth that is intimidating to anyone from a Ph.D. on down. Imagine the negative impact on a high school student? Less is more in the early steps of learning. Later the students can expand their knowledge if not crushed in the first contact with it. <br /><br />If this simple approach was good enough to help Choate students get into Harvard, it should be good for the rest of us! Enjoy. It's fun to test oneself on these words, no matter your purpose for doing so. This is a perfect listen on the way to school, work, or the test itself!"},

"description":"Renowned psychologist Walter Mischel, designer of the famous Marshmallow Test, explains what self-control is and how to master it. <br /><br />A child is presented with a marshmallow and given a choice: Eat this one now, or wait and enjoy two later. What will she do? And what are the implications for her behavior later in life? <br /><br />The world's leading expert on self-control, Walter Mischel has proven that the ability to delay gratification is critical for a successful life, predicting higher SAT scores, better social and cognitive functioning, a healthier lifestyle and a greater sense of self-worth. But is willpower prewired, or can it be taught? <br /><br />In <i>The Marshmallow Test<\/i>, Mischel explains how self-control can be mastered and applied to challenges in everyday life - from weight control to quitting smoking, overcoming heartbreak, making major decisions, and planning for retirement. With profound implications for the choices we make in parenting, education, public policy and self-care, <i>The Marshmallow Test<\/i> will change the way you think about who we are and what we can be."},

"description":"Guaranteed to give the student a solid core list of words for the SATs. Unlike most SAT prep courses, this short concise audiobook is laser focused on the words themselves. It does not wear down and intimidate the student with length and breadth. This list was first developed at Choate, the distinguished American preparatory school with a wide range of graduates ranging from Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy to Edward Albee and the actor Michael Douglas. Choate had a long honored tradition of not only getting its graduates into Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, but also having over 75% of them graduate in the top half of those classes. Choate, along with Andover and Exeter, were the only schools that the Harvard Admission Office would predict their students would have a higher grade point than at their high school. <br /><br />It is from this tradition of laser focused learning that this SAT prep audiobook comes. The words were first put forth by a legendary teacher, John Joseph, as the core 100. \"Get these right and we can move on; but first get these memorized.\" As the audiobook says, Choate had the confidence to start simply with a foundation in a subject before moving to greater efforts. This is such an audiobook. <br /><br />The SAT words have remained largely the same over 50 years. A comparison to other texts indicates that about 98% of the words have been the same over this period, as an educated listener would expect. After this basic non-intimidating approach, a student can move on to the SAT and GRE 500 Words. But first start at the beginning. <br /><br />With the Core 100 words students will enjoy the speed at which they master this foundation of the language without having to wade through a long audiobook to get to this core knowledge. The very shortness encourages students to relisten to master this core subject."},

This way, she's guaranteed to be paired up with infuriating (but no less delectable man-thing) coworker Matt Jacobs on a new account. If she's caught, she'll be neck-deep in pink slips. Unfortunately, working closely with Matt could land her in deeper - and much, much hotter - water.<br />Turns out Matt and Carly couldn't be more suited for each other...sexually. And when Matt discovers that Carly's cute exterior conceals thoughts lusty enough to make a porn star blush, he can barely keep himself from pulling her into an empty office, locking the door and putting the sex survey's results to the test...but good!"},

"description":"Khai Diep has no feelings. Well, he feels irritation when people move his things or contentment when ledgers balance down to the penny‚ but not important emotions, like love. His family knows better—that his autism means he just processes emotions differently. When he steadfastly avoids relationships, his mother takes matters into her own hands and returns to Vietnam to find him the perfect bride.<br /><br />As a mixed-race girl living in the slums of Ho Chi Minh City, Esme Tran has always felt out of place. When the opportunity arises to come to America and meet a potential husband, she can't turn it down. Seducing Khai, however, doesn't go as planned. She's hopelessly smitten with a man who's convinced he can never return her affection."},
